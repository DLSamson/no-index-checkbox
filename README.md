# No Index Checkbox

> This package was made for Modx Revolution 2.8

No index checkbox for resources in Modx Revolution. 

This package adds noIndex checkbox, so you can easily put "noindex,nofollow" metatag on every page you need via admin content panel

To build and install this package, just clone it into your clear modx install, and run this:

```bash
php NoIndexBox/_build/build.php
```

This will create a transport package in `MODX_CORE_PATH/packages`, so you can use it everywhere
